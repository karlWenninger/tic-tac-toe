## Tic-Tac-Toe

Play against 'opponents' Albert Einstein or Donald Trump. Einstein is unbeatable—he wins or you tie. The Trump 'player' switches between the unbeatable algorithm and completely random moves. As a result Trump is erratic and unpredictable. 

### PLEASE NOTE:
I put this together summer 2019—*before* all the absolute chaos of 2020-21. A revison is on my to do list.
